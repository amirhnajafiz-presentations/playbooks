# Ansible Playbooks

As you know, Ansible is a powerful tool for configuring your hosts.
In this repository, I stored playbooks that I usually use whenever I want to config a machine.
Each directory is an Ansible playbook that installs a module on target hosts.

## Hosts

Make sure to change the ```hosts.yml``` file based on your machines addresses.

## ansible.cfg

You can also modify the ```ansible.cfg``` file to change the ansible configs.
